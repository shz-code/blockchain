# ERC-20 Implementation (MariaCoin)

This is an implementation of the ERC-20 token standard in Solidity. The ERC-20 standard defines a common set of rules and interfaces that Ethereum tokens should follow to ensure compatibility with the broader Ethereum ecosystem.

# Prerequisites
To run and test the ERC-20 implementation, you need the following:

- Ethereum development environment (e.g., Remix, Truffle, Hardhat)


# Features
To use the ERC-20 token, follow these steps:

- Deploy the ERC20 contract to your Ethereum network.

- Interact with the contract using the provided functions, such as `transfer`, `approve`, and `transferFrom`, to perform token transfers and manage `allowances`.

- Use the ERC20 events to track token transfers and approvals.
